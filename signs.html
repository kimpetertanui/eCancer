It usually takes years, if not decades, for abnormal cells to develop into cervical cancer. These abnormal cells are often harmless and don’t cause any, or only few, symptoms. If they develop into cancer, it can cause the following symptoms:

abnormal bleeding – for instance after sex, between periods or after the menopause
abnormal vaginal discharge that might have an unpleasant odor
tiredness and weight loss
pain in the abdomen and pelvis
pain when urinating (“peeing”)
By the time cervical cancer starts causing symptoms, it is often already at quite an advanced stage.
